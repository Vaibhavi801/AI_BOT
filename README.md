# AI Chatbot with NLP (Python)

##  Project Overview
This project implements an **AI-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python.  
The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries, maintaining basic conversation context, and responding intelligently without repeating answers unnecessarily.

The chatbot is built using **NLTK** for text preprocessing and **scikit-learn** for similarity matching.

##  Objectives
- To build a chatbot using **NLP techniques**
- To process and understand user input text
- To classify user intents and generate appropriate responses
- To implement **context awareness** in conversations
- To avoid repetitive responses and improve user interaction

---

##  Features
- Natural Language Processing using **NLTK**
- TF-IDF vectorization for text representation
- Cosine similarity for intent matching
- Context-aware conversation handling
- Intelligent continuation handling (e.g., *“go ahead”*)
- Neutral acknowledgements (*“okay”, “ok”*) without unintended responses
- Terminal-based interactive chatbot

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
- **Scikit-learn**
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity
